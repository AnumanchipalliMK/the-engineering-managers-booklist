### Book selection

The books or subjects aren't in any particular order so feel free to dive into the topics that you want to learn more about.

### Reading advice

Personally, I prefer audiobooks. They allow me to listen to books while I'm cooking in the kitchen, cleaning up my room, taking a walk around my neighborhood, commuting, etc. Usually, I listen to them at 1.5x to 2x the speed depending on how fast the person narrates the book.
